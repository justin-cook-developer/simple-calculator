Everything for simple calculator will be generated with javascript.

    NOTES:
	On createElement() - Once this thing is created it is in face a complete object
	   there is no mystery to unfold. You can manipulate it all you want and just
	   dump it in an existing element.
	   Apparently the thing to do is set outerHTML. Setting innerText provided nothing.
	   The element created need to be appended to its parent before we can do anything
	   meaningful with that thing, beyond just setting up.
